👋 Hi there! I’m an Diego Ledesma @jdledesmac, Electronics Engineer with 8+ years of experience in cellular network integration and optimization (UMTS, LTE, and 5G). 

I’m passionate about coding and data analysis — I enjoy building tools that transform raw network data into actionable insights. Most of my projects involve Python, with a focus on automation, KPI visualization, and performance analytics.

In addition to my telecom background, I’ve developed freelance projects using Python to create tailored solutions for different companies, integrating APIs and developing automation scripts to improve efficiency and data connectivity.

I’m continuously learning and exploring new technologies:



🏆 Highlight: National academic recognition for achieving the highest score in Colombia’s SaberPro 2013 exam in Electronic Engineering.

💡 Tech Interests: Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Inteligence, other programming languages like C# and Scala.
